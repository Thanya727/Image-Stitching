# Image-Stitching
This project revolves around the implementation of image stitching techniques to seamlessly combine multiple images into a panoramic view. The objective is to overcome the limitations of individual images and create a cohesive and immersive visual representation. By leveraging advanced computer vision algorithms and image processing, the project aims to automatically detect overlapping regions in input images, align them, and blend the seams to produce a visually pleasing and distortion-free panoramic output. The proposed solution not only involves traditional methods like feature matching and homography estimation but also explores the integration of deep learning approaches for more robust and accurate image stitching.
